## GPT API Price Calculator

This is a Streamlit web application that allows you to calculate the cost of using OpenAI's GPT API based on the amount of text you input and the selected GPT model.

You can access the web application at the following URL: https://gpt-api-price-calculator.app/

### Input Format

For text input, use the following format to separate user and assistant dialogues:

* Type "## USER" before the user's dialogue.
* Type "## ASSISTANT" before the assistant's dialogue.

For example:

```
## USER
Hi, how are you?

## ASSISTANT
I'm doing well, thank you. How can I assist you today?
```

### API Pricing

Here's a reference pricing for the available GPT models:

| Model | Prompt Price (USD / 1K tokens) | Completion Price (USD / 1K tokens) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| gpt-3.5-turbo | 0.002 | 0.002 |
